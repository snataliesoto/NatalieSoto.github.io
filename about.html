          <h4>Natalie Soto-Bernal</h4>
          <p>My full name is Natalie Soto-Bernal. I was born in the borough, Manhattan, though raised in Queens. I'm a student enrolled at New York City College of Technology, currently majoring in communication design. My favorite past times include drawing, reading, photography and numerous others. My aspirations include becoming a full time graphic designer, one that can also include other elements of design such as my illustrations and my own bits of photography.</p>
